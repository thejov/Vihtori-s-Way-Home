Vihtori's Way Home is a browser based animation implemented only with CSS3 and HTML.

The animation was done within the scope of a school project at the Aalto University.
We experimented with some of CSS3's new features, e.g. animation and 2D/3D-transformations.
We wanted to do a proof of concept on what can be achieved by using only CSS3 and HTML and by excluding the commonly used JavaScript language.

Implementation was done mainly in pair programming on one computer, so all commits are only from one developer. Yet all the work was actually divided 50/50.
