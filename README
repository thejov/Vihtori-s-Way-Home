Vihtori's Way Home is a browser based animation implemented only with CSS3 and HTML.

We wanted to do a proof of concept on what can be achieved by using only these two
technologies and e.g. no javascript. We experimented on some of CSS3's new features,
 e.g. animation and 2D/3D-transformations.

Implementation was done mainly in pair programming on one computer, so all commits are only from one developer. Yet all the work was actually divided 50/50.
